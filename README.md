## Prerequisites

Please install or have installed the following:

- [nodejs and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Installation

1. [Install Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html), if you haven't already. Here is a simple way to install brownie.

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
# restart your terminal
pipx install eth-brownie
```

Or, if that doesn't work, via pip

```bash
pip install eth-brownie
```

2. Download the mix and install dependencies.

```bash
brownie bake chainlink-mix
cd chainlink-mix
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will open up a new Chainlink project. Or, you can clone from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/chainlink-mix
cd chainlink-mix
```

## Testnet Development

If you want to be able to deploy to testnets, do the following.

Set your `WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID`, and `PRIVATE_KEY` [environment variables](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/01/how-to-set-environment-variables.html).

You can get a `WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID` by getting a free trial of [Infura](https://infura.io/). At the moment, it does need to be infura with brownie. If you get lost, you can [follow this guide](https://ethereumico.io/knowledge-base/infura-api-key-guide/) to getting a project key. You can find your `PRIVATE_KEY` from your ethereum wallet like [metamask](https://metamask.io/).

You'll also need testnet ETH and LINK. You can get LINK and ETH into your wallet by using the [faucets located here](https://faucets.chain.link/). If you're new to this, [watch this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7FX_1PePX0). Look at the `sepolia` section for those specific testnet faucets.

You can add your environment variables to a `.env` file. You can use the [.env.exmple](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-mix/blob/master/.env.example) as a template, just fill in the values and rename it to '.env'. Then, uncomment the line `# dotenv: .env` in `brownie-config.yaml`

Here is what your `.env` should look like:

```
export WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID=<PROJECT_ID>
export PRIVATE_KEY=<PRIVATE_KEY>
```

AND THEN RUN `source .env` TO ACTIVATE THE ENV VARIABLES
(You'll need to do this every time you open a new terminal, or [learn how to set them easier](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/01/how-to-set-environment-variables.html))

![WARNING](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) **WARNING** ![WARNING](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=+)

DO NOT SEND YOUR PRIVATE KEY WITH FUNDS IN IT ONTO GITHUB

Otherwise, you can build, test, and deploy on your local environment.

## Local Development

For local testing [install ganache-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ganache-cli)

```bash
npm install -g ganache-cli
```

or

```bash
yarn add global ganache-cli
```

All the scripts are designed to work locally or on a testnet. You can add a ganache-cli or ganache UI chain like so:

```
brownie networks add Ethereum ganache host=http://localhost:8545 chainid=1337
```

And update the brownie config accordingly. There is a `deploy_mocks` script that will launch and deploy mock Oracles, VRFCoordinators, Link Tokens, and Price Feeds on a Local Blockchain.

## Running Scripts and Deployment

This mix provides a simple template for working with Chainlink Smart Contracts. The easiest way to start is to fork the mainnet chain to a local ganache chain. This will allow you to deploy local smart contracts to interact with the [Chainlink Price Feeds](https://docs.chain.link/docs/get-the-latest-price).

> NOTE: It's highly encouraged that you work with a local chain before testing on a testnet. You'll be a much faster developer!

If Sepolia network is not added to brownie by default, run:

```
brownie networks add Ethereum sepolia host=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/$WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID chainid=11155111 explorer=https://sepolia.etherscan.io/
```

### Chainlink Price Feeds

This will deploy a smart contract to Sepolia and then read you the latest price via [Chainlink Price Feeds](https://docs.chain.link/docs/get-the-latest-price).

```
brownie run scripts/price_feed_scripts/01_deploy_price_consumer_v3.py --network sepolia
brownie run scripts/price_feed_scripts/02_read_price_feed.py --network sepolia
```

Or, you can use [ENS](https://docs.chain.link/docs/ens)

```
brownie run scripts/price_feed_scripts/02_read_price_feed_with_ens.py --network sepolia
```

Otherwise, you can fork mainnet and use that in a local ganache development environment.

```bash
brownie console --network mainnet-fork
>>> price_feeds = PriceFeedConsumer.deploy('0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419', {'from': accounts[0]})
.
.
>>> latest_price = price_feeds.getLatestPrice()
>>> latest_price
59169208540
```

You can also use [ENS](https://docs.chain.link/docs/ens) to get prices. See the [ens price feed script](./scripts/price_feed_scripts/read_price_with_ens.py) for more information.

### Chainlink VRF

This will deploy a smart contract to Sepolia and get a Random number via [Chainlink VRF](https://docs.chain.link/docs/get-a-random-number).

If you haven't created and funded a subscription on [vrf.chain.link](https://vrf.chain.link/) you can do so on the UI, or by running:

```
brownie run scripts/vrf_scripts/create_subscription.py --network sepolia
```

Before running the next scripts. Running `01_deploy_vrf` will also add your consumer contract to the registry.

```
brownie run scripts/vrf_scripts/01_deploy_vrf_consumer.py --network sepolia
brownie run scripts/vrf_scripts/02_request_randomness.py --network sepolia
brownie run scripts/vrf_scripts/03_read_random_number.py --network sepolia
```

### Chainlink API Call

This will deploy a smart contract to Sepolia and then make an API call via [Chainlink API Call](https://docs.chain.link/docs/make-a-http-get-request).

```
brownie run scripts/chainlink_api_scripts/01_deploy_api_consumer.py --network sepolia
brownie run scripts/chainlink_api_scripts/02_request_api.py --network sepolia
brownie run scripts/chainlink_api_scripts/03_read_data.py --network sepolia
```

### Chainlink Automation Deployment

This is just to show you how to deploy the Automation Compatible contracts, you can learn more about registering & using them in the [Automate Contracts](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-automation/compatible-contracts/) section of the Chainlink documentation.

```
brownie run scripts/automation_scripts/01_deploy_automation_counter.py --network sepolia
brownie run scripts/automation_scripts/02_check_upkeep.py --network sepolia
```

### Local Development

For local development, you might want to deploy mocks. You can run the script to deploy mocks. Depending on your setup, it might make sense to _not_ deploy mocks if you're looking to fork a mainnet. It all depends on what you're looking to do though. Right now, the scripts automatically deploy a mock so they can run.

## Testing

```
brownie test
```

For more information on effective testing with Chainlink, check out [Testing Smart Contracts](https://blog.chain.link/testing-chainlink-smart-contracts/)

Tests are really robust here! They work for local development and testnets. There are a few key differences between the testnets and the local networks. We utilize mocks so we can work with fake oracles on our testnets.

There is a `test_unnecessary` folder, which is a good exercise for learning some of the nitty-gritty of smart contract development. It's overkill, so pytest will skip them intentionally. It also has a `test_samples` folder, which shows an example Chainlink API call transaction receipt.

### To test development / local

```bash
brownie test
```

### To test mainnet-fork

This will test the same way as local testing, but you will need a connection to a mainnet blockchain (like with the infura environment variable.)

```bash
brownie test --network mainnet-fork
```

### To test a testnet

Sepolia is currently supported. Please check the Chainlink docs for which products are supported on which chains.

```bash
brownie test --network sepolia
```

## Adding additional Chains

If the blockchain is EVM Compatible, adding new chains can be accomplished by something like:

```
brownie networks add Ethereum binance-smart-chain host=https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org chainid=56
```

or, for a fork:

```
brownie networks add development binance-fork cmd=ganache-cli host=http://127.0.0.1 fork=https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org accounts=10 mnemonic=brownie port=8545
```

## Linting

```
pip install black
pip install autoflake
autoflake --in-place --remove-unused-variables --remove-all-unused-imports -r .
black .
```

If you're using [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [solidity extension](https://github.com/juanfranblanco/vscode-solidity), you can create a folder called `.vscode` at the root folder of this project, and create a file called `settings.json`, and add the following content:

```json
{
  "solidity.remappings": [
    "@chainlink/=[YOUR_HOME_DIR]/.brownie/packages/smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts@0.2.2",
    "@openzeppelin/=[YOUR_HOME_DIR]/.brownie/packages/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@4.3.2"
  ]
}
```

This will quiet the linting errors it gives you.
